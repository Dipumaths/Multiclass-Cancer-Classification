•Analyzed RNA-Seq data of 802patients (20K+genes) across five cancer types to identify key predictive genetic markers

•Applied PCA,LDA,t-SNEand built models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network) for cancer classification

•Reached the highest accuracy with Neural Network and demonstrated ensembles surpassing traditional classifier
